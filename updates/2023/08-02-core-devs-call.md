# Mainnet

Shapella went through smoothly
Checkpoint sync
Investigation needed
Forgot to check that web3signer was updated
Was discovered less than 24 hours before the fork
Had to put out urgent comms to update this on Dappnode and for users who need web3signer in their infra (i.e. StakeWise)
Participation dropped from 96 to 90% for a few epochs but went up to 95% very quickly right after
Went really well
Erigon nodes werenâ€™t synced for the hard fork (forkmon, ethstats, grafana)

# Hive Tests

From the 20 tests passing on Nethermind, only 14 tests pass for Erigon right now
