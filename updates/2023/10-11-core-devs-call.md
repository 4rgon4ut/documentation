# Client Team Updates
## EL

* **Nethermind**: 
* Working on internal dencun specific things for Gnosis
* Right now 4844 variables are hardcoded in Nethermind and theyâ€™re working on making this configurable
* A new release candidate is underway, majorly integrating cancun features along with some fixes.

* **Erigon**: 
No one present

* **Geth**:
  * Not much progress since last week, mostly investigating
  * 2 branches
    * One that extracts the data from the Nethermind DB and creates the DB to use by the next branch
      * Figured out why it was running out of memory: memory leak in the transaction pool, but didnâ€™t spend too much debugging because of the new branch
    * One that is more modern and supports withdrawals, but doesnâ€™t currently sync.
      * Has issues connecting to other nodes in the network.

# Chain Infra

* **Gateway**
No one present

# Hive Tests

* Fixed the withdrawal issues after merge.
* Working on the dencun tests.

# Devnet

* The devnet nodes have been stable and the network is finalizing
* Lighthouse requires the preset to be built in?
* The blob transaction spammer has some issues, it would be better to try to internal Nethermind tool
* Running with the min gas per blob preset since Friday
* Two more parameters need to be updated, and we need to spin up a new devnet with Erigon from the get go
