# Client Team Updates

## EL

- **Nethermind**:

  - Finished some Gnosis-specific features
    - Configurable EIP-4844 configurations
  - Cancun merged to main branch
  - Kickstarted an initiative to rework the `eth_getLogs` system to optimize it

- **Erigon**:

  - Sync issues (OOM on 32 GB nodes also running CL)
    - Exclusively happens in Docker, GOMAXPROC should be a workaround (4 instead of 24 for example)
  - High disk usage (400 GB with `--prune=hrtc` vs 170 GB on Nethermind for the standard `gnosis` preset)
  - Fairly unreliable (I have to restart it every few days at this point, maybe too many attached validators? I miss quite a few epochs on mainnet too but donâ€™t need to restart at least.)
  - Configurable EIP-4844 configurations are merged
  - Working on Erigon 3

- **Geth**:
  - Tried the static peers and it seems to work better
  - Still not getting a connection
    - The old branch systematically uses eth/66 and that works
    - The new branch gets disconnected when trying to connect to eth/66

# Dencun

- Config
  - Max churn limit of 2
  - Target and max blobs per block
  - Security first: 1/2
    - Thoughts of EL devs?
  - https://github.com/gnosischain/specs/pull/24
  - BLOB_GASPRICE_UPDATE_FRACTION=1112826

# Chain Infra

- **Gateway**
  - Discovered a bug in the load balancer that resulted in 0.5 to 1% of errors at the current load
    - Sudden increase in `eth_getLogs`, which are typically quite slow on the nodes, which were subsequently falling behind
    - The solution was to account for this slowness

# Gnosis

- The public RPC was down during the weekend, but that was because of Gnosis.

# Hive Tests

- Solved the configuration issues for Dencun
- Working on an error when sending blobs

# Devnet

- Has Erigon joined?
  - `thorax/erigon:docker_gno_dencun_devnet_0`
  - `--chain=gno_dencun_0`
  - Issues with the internal CL
  - Not tested yet

# Research

- Automatic sync tests
