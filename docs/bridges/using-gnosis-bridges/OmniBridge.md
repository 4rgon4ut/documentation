## Transfer any ERC-20 token from Ethereum to Gnosis
It is possible to use the OmniBridge UI to transfer any ERC20 from Ethereum to xDai. Any user can initiate this initial transfer. Once the token exists on Gnosis, it can be transferred back and forth using the same UI.

### Token Transfer
We transfer an ERC20 token from Ethereum to xDai. When this process was started, this token does not yet exist on Gnosis. It takes less than 5 minutes and some ETH for gas fees.

1. Go the the OmniBridge UI
   - Connect your wallet to the Ethereum Mainnet
   - Select the token you want to transfer and enter the amount of token you want.
   - Click Unlock and approve the account interaction.

2. Confirm the transaction to approve.
3. Once transaction approval is complete, you can now transfer your selected token from Ethereum to Gnosis Chain. You can now finally transfer and move on next steps.
4. Press Confirm to approve the transfer and pay the gas fees. These may be expensive depending on network congestion. We recommend checking current gas prices. Because of high fees, it also may make sense to bridge over a larger amount of tokens in a single transaction rather than several smaller ones.
5. The bridge transaction will begin to process. While you are waiting for block confirmations, you can click on the ALM monitor link to view progress of your transfer, or you can view the [ALM monitor here](https://alm-bridge-monitor.gnosischain.com/) and look up your transaction by the transaction hash.
