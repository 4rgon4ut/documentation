:::note
You will need some Dai to transfer and some ETH for gas (transaction fees). Bridge minimum/maximum amounts are set by the bridge governors. Bridge may take some time to update chain stats, try refreshing or waiting a minute if you receive any errors. You can also select a different RPC in the Settings dropdown
