        title="What is Gnosis Bridge?"
        subtitle="Gnosis Chain bridge allows you to bridge assets from Gnosis Chain to Ethereum and vice-versa. It mints the canonical representations of bridged assets on Gnosis and connects Gnosis to Ethereum. The requested token amount is minted and sent to the account initiating the transfer (or an alternative receiver account specified by the sender).
        Read more here on architecture of Omni Bridge."

<Card
        title="How to use this bridge for xDAI tokens ?"
        subtitle="Gnosis Omni bridge also acts as a native Dai bridge from Ethereum that is used to mint and burn xDai, the native asset used for gas and transaction fees on Gnosis Chain. This bridge allows users to transform DAI (an ERC20 stable token) on the mainnet into xDAI on a compatible chain. xDAI tokens can then be sent quickly and with minimal cost on the xDAI network."
