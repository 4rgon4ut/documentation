Gnosis is investing significant resources into trust-minimization of its Bridges, to ensure trust and safety of users. 

### "Proof-of-Deposit" Validity Proofs

One emergent idea is to require Bridge Validators to provide a "proof-of-deposit" to the receiving bridge contract, as a proof that funds were indeed deposited in the origin chain. This can be done through a variety of cryptographic signature schemes. 

Gnosis has provided a $600k grant to [0xParc](https://0xparc.org/) to fund R&D into a zkSNARK-enabled light client, a necessary part of a trust-minimized bridge (see [GIP-57 proposal](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-57-should-gnosis-dao-support-research-of-a-zksnark-enabled-light-client-and-bridge/5421)). 

There is an additional effort by the original xDai team into [BLS-signature based trustless bridge](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-57-should-gnosis-dao-support-research-of-a-zksnark-enabled-light-client-and-bridge/5421/15?u=dan-gnosis), as an alternative to a SNARKs.

### Hashi - A cross chain protocol based on distributed trust of the underlying security mechanisms
Hashi, a cross chain protocol based on distributed trust of the underlying security mechanisms
Hashi is an EVM Hash Oracle Aggregator designed to enhance cross-chain bridge security by aggregating block headers from various sources. By requiring validation from multiple independent mechanisms, Hashi ensures greater resilience against security incidents. It supports 15+ General Message Passing bridges and ZK light clients, promoting redundancy and reducing reliance on single mechanisms. Integrating Hashi into Gnosis Chain's bridges strengthens security, decentralization, and interoperability. This initiative aims to set a new standard for cross-chain transactions, enhancing user confidence and bolstering the Gnosis ecosystem's security posture.

### Telepathy, zkSNARK-enabled Light Client bridge validator
Succinct Lab's zkSNARK-enabled Light Client, Telepathy, launched in July 2023, has emerged as a key component of the AMB bridge ecosystem. Utilizing zkSNARKs, Telepathy provides validity proofs, ensuring trustless verification of transaction events across chains. This solution has become one of the most active bridge validators in the AMB network, enhancing security and reliability for cross-chain transactions.

After successful audits and release, we aim to gradually migrate our canonical bridges to Hashiâ€™s distributed trust model.
