# Understanding Account Abstraction

<CardContainer>
<Card
    title="What is Account Abstraction ? "
    subtitle="Account abstraction allows for more flexible and user-friendly account models beyond the traditional externally owned accounts (EOAs). With AA, smart contract wallets can initiate transactions, enabling more complex logic like multi-signature verification, recovery mechanisms, and gas fee payments in tokens. AA revolves around the idea of avoiding the need for change in concensus layer."
