## What is Gnosis Chain?
Gnosis Chain, formerly xDAI chain, is a blockchain that enables the development of applications and organizations, as well as the management of assets, transactions, and communication without the need for a centralized authority. It is an Ethereum [sidechain](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/sidechains/), powered by stable payments [EVM](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/#top) for fast and inexpensive transactions.
