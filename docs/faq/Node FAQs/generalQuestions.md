# General Questions

1. **What is a validator?**
   
   Validators propose and vote on blocks to include in the chain. The chain is secured by a staked amount of GNO. Validators stake GNO and receive additional GNO as rewards for correct behavior (proposing and attesting blocks) and a slashed balance as penalties for incorrect behavior (offline node, attesting invalid blocks).

2. **What is PoS (Proof-of-Stake)?**

 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism for processing transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain. Staking is when you pledge your coins to be used for verifying transactions. The same PoS implementation underlies both Gnosis Chain and Ethereum's consensus mechanism, except for a few differences outlined [here](https://docs.gnosischain.com/about/).

3. **What is Gnosis Chain?**

 Gnosis Chain is an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain that aspires to be the most secure, resilient and credibly neutral blockchain, buttressed by a deeply decentralized network secured by over 200K validators.

5. **What tax software has integrated GC?**

    [Cryptio](https://cryptio.co/) is available for German users.
